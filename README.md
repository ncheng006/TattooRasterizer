# CS 184 Final Project: Tattoo style rendering 

In this project, we will explore non-photorealistic rendering to create a tool for tattoo artists to easily generate designs in different tattoo styles. By altering how light is rendered in a typical photorealistic manner we have learned in class, we will create more expressive and artistic images in a sketch, stick & poke, chrome, and american traditional tattoo styles.
