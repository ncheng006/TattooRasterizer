# CS 184 Final Project: Tattoo style rendering 

# Project Description
This project aims to explore non-photorealistic rendering techniques to develop a tool for tattoo artists. The tool will enable tattoo artists to effortlessly generate tattoo designs in various styles, including sketch, stick & poke, chrome, and American traditional. Instead of adhering to the traditional photorealistic rendering methods commonly taught in art classes, we will experiment with altering the rendering of light to produce more expressive and artistic images.

# Motivation
Tattoo artists often face the challenge of creating unique and visually striking designs that cater to diverse client preferences. While traditional photorealistic techniques have their merits, non-photorealistic rendering allows for a more creative and dynamic approach to tattoo design. By harnessing the power of digital tools and algorithms, tattoo artists can explore new styles and generate designs that stand out in the world of body art.
